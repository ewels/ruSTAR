# ruSTAR

A Rust reimplementation of [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference), the widely-used RNA-seq aligner originally written in C++ by Alexander Dobin.

## Overview

ruSTAR aims to be a faithful port of STAR, matching the original behavior as closely as possible. It uses the same genome index format, accepts the same `--camelCase` command-line parameters, and produces compatible SAM/BAM output.

**Current status**: End-to-end single-end and paired-end RNA-seq alignment with splice junction detection, two-pass mode, chimeric alignment detection, and multi-threaded parallel processing. 268 tests passing (264 unit + 4 integration).

## Quick Start

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Generate genome index

```bash
target/release/ruSTAR --runMode genomeGenerate \
  --genomeDir /path/to/genome_index \
  --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/genome.fa
```

### Align reads

```bash
target/release/ruSTAR \
  --genomeDir /path/to/genome_index \
  --readFilesIn reads.fq \
  --outSAMtype SAM \
  --outSAMstrandField intronMotif \
  --outFileNamePrefix /path/to/output_
```

### Paired-end alignment

```bash
target/release/ruSTAR \
  --genomeDir /path/to/genome_index \
  --readFilesIn reads_1.fq reads_2.fq \
  --outSAMtype SAM \
  --outFileNamePrefix /path/to/output_
```

### BAM output

```bash
target/release/ruSTAR \
  --genomeDir /path/to/genome_index \
  --readFilesIn reads.fq \
  --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted \
  --outFileNamePrefix /path/to/output_
```

### Two-pass mode

```bash
target/release/ruSTAR \
  --genomeDir /path/to/genome_index \
  --readFilesIn reads.fq \
  --twopassMode Basic \
  --outFileNamePrefix /path/to/output_
```

## Accuracy Comparison vs STAR

Benchmarked on 10,000 yeast RNA-seq reads (150 bp SE, ERR12389696), compared to STAR 2.7.x with identical parameters and genome index.

### Single-End Alignment Rates

| Metric | ruSTAR | STAR |
|--------|--------|------|
| Unique mapped | 92.6% | 92.6% |
| Multi-mapped | 7.4% | 7.4% |
| Soft-clipped reads | 26.0% | 26.0% |
| Splice rate | 2.2% | 2.2% |
| Shared splice junctions | 67 / 72 STAR junctions | — |
| Motif agreement (shared junctions) | 100% | — |

### Strict Per-Read Comparison (SE)

A read is counted as a **match** only if it aligns to the exact same chromosome, exact same start position, and has identical splice junctions (intron coordinates). Any difference in any of these is a mismatch.

| Result | Count | % |
|--------|-------|---|
| Exact match (chr + pos + CIGAR identical) | 8799 | 98.57% |
| Splice match (chr + pos + introns match, CIGAR differs) | 1 | 0.01% |
| **Total match** | **8800** | **98.57%** |
| Mismatch — unavoidable tie-breaking | 126 | 1.41% |
| Mismatch — fixable algorithm differences | 26 | 0.29% |
| **Parity (excluding unavoidable ties)** | **8800 / 8826** | **99.70%** |

#### Mismatch Classification

| Category | Count | Fixable? |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Diff chromosome, both multi-mapper (repeat copy tie-breaking) | 100 | No — same score, different copy chosen |
| Same chr, identical CIGAR, different position (repeat copy tie-breaking) | ~19 | No — same score, different copy chosen |
| Wrong intron choice (same chr, different large intron) | 4 | Partial |
| ruSTAR false splice (adapter contamination, 279 kb intron) | 1 | Yes |
| STAR-only mapped (high-mismatch read, NM=10) | 1 | Unknown |
| MAPQ inflation (missed splice/indel secondary) | 4 | Partial |
| MAPQ deflation (extra unspliced secondary) | 4 | Partial |

> **Unavoidable ties (~119 reads):** Both tools find the same set of equally-scored alignments but choose different ones as primary due to internal processing order. Neither alignment is more correct than the other.

### MAPQ Agreement (SE)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAPQ agreement (position-matched reads) | 99.9% |
| MAPQ inflation (ruSTAR=255, STAR<255) | 4 reads |
| MAPQ deflation (ruSTAR<255, STAR=255) | 4 reads |

### Paired-End (10k yeast read pairs, 150 bp)

| Metric | ruSTAR | STAR |
|--------|--------|------|
| Both mates mapped | 8245 | 8390 |
| Half-mapped pairs | 0 | 0 |
| Unmapped pairs | 0 | 0 |
| ruSTAR-only mapped pairs | 12 | — |
| STAR-only mapped pairs | 157 | — |
| Per-mate position agreement | 98.0% | — |
| Per-mate CIGAR agreement | 96.7% | — |

> **PE parity in progress**: ruSTAR uses STAR's combined-read PE path (`[mate1_fwd][SPACER][RC(mate2)]`). The 12 ruSTAR-only false positives are overlapping pairs with marginally elevated combined-read scores. The 157 STAR-only missed pairs include 35 where ruSTAR's raw stitching score is slightly below STAR's (exposed by the genomic-length score penalty added in Phase 16.31) and 122 pre-existing gaps under investigation.
