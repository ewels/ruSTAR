                                                                        └→ Phase 16.14 (Nstart fix, 99.5% pos) ✅

                                                              └→ Phase 14 (STARsolo) [DEFERRED]
```

**Phase ordering rationale**: Threading (Phase 9) done first to establish parallel architecture.
Paired-end (Phase 8) builds on threaded infrastructure. GTF/junctions (Phase 7) done after core parallelism.

---

## Phase 16: Algorithm Parity ✅ (partial)

See [docs/phase16_algorithm.md](docs/phase16_algorithm.md) for sub-phase notes (16.1-16.13), [docs/phase16_14_nstart_fix.md](docs/phase16_14_nstart_fix.md) for the Nstart fix.

**Summary**: Bin-based windowing, pre-DP seed extension, MMP SA range narrowing, multi-transcript DP, recursive combinatorial stitcher, STAR-faithful scoring (scoreStitchSJshift removed), sparse bidirectional seed search with Nstart +1 fix, WALrec persistent threshold, post-jR shared base scoring, hierarchical SAindex lookup, nWA reset + overlap detection, coverage filter removal, Lread-1 filter fix, too-many-loci filter, mate rescue, SA range narrowing fix (find_mult_range + max_mappable_length), reverse-strand stitcher coordinate fix (RC read + forward genome coords), PE joint DP stitching via combined-read path, STAR-faithful PE architecture (no cross-product), combined-read score threshold fix (pre-split check prevents double-counting), extendAlign EXTEND_ORDER fix (5' of read first; reverse-strand reads extend right before left) + float comparison fix.

**SE parity (10k yeast, post Phase 16.29):**

| Category | Count | % | Fixable? |
|----------|-------|---|----------|
| Exact match (chr + pos + CIGAR) | 8799 | 98.57% | — |
| Splice match (chr + pos + introns, CIGAR differs) | 1 | 0.01% | — |
| **Total match** | **8800** | **98.57%** | — |
| Unavoidable ties (repeat copy tiebreaking, same score) | 126 | 1.41% | No |
| Fixable algorithm differences | 26 | 0.29% | Yes |
| **Parity excl. unavoidable ties** | **8800/8826** | **99.70%** | — |

**Adjusted SE summary (post Phase 16.29)**: 99.7% position agreement, 99.9% CIGAR, 2.2% splice rate (= STAR), 99.9% MAPQ, 26 actionable disagreements, 1 STAR-only / 1 ruSTAR-only. MAPQ inflation: 4 reads, MAPQ deflation: 4 reads.

**PE parity (10k yeast pairs, 150 bp, post Phase 16.31):**

| Metric | ruSTAR | STAR |
|--------|--------|------|
| Both-mapped pairs | 8245 | 8390 |
| Half-mapped pairs | 0 | 0 |
| Net gap | −145 (ruSTAR under) | — |
| Per-mate position agreement | ~98.0% | — |
| Per-mate CIGAR agreement | ~96.7% | — |
| ruSTAR-only false positives | 12 | — |
| STAR-only missed | 157 | — |

**PE implementation path:**
- Phase 16.PE1: Recursive combinatorial stitcher (`stitch_recurse`) replacing forward DP
- Phase 16.PE2: STAR-faithful combined-read approach `[mate1_fwd][SPACER][RC(mate2)]`; `mate_id` tagging; `split_working_transcript`; overlap consistency checks
- Phase 16.PE3: Removed non-STAR independent SE + cross-product path; decision tree: joint pairs only → TooShort/unmapped
- Score threshold fix: `split_working_transcript` copies `wt.score` to both halves; checking `wt1.score+wt2.score` doubled the threshold. Fixed to check `wt.score < combined_score_threshold` before split.
- Phase 16.28: extendAlign EXTEND_ORDER fix — for reverse-strand alignments, extend right (5' of read) before left.
- Phase 16.30: PE overlap check fix — forward cluster check 1 uses post-extension estimate for mate1 genome start.
- D5 (2026-03-12): Overlapping-mate junction consistency check (`pe_junctions_consistent`). Removed 2 false-positive pairs where splice junctions in the overlapping genome region disagreed between mates.
- Palindromic early-exit removed (2026-03-16): `if mate1_seq == rc_mate2 { return TooShort }` was wrong — STAR maps palindromic zero-insert RF pairs. Recovered ~28 pairs.

**Phase 16.31 (2026-03-25):** Applied `scoreGenomicLengthLog2scale` penalty to combined PE WT score before threshold check (`stitchWindowAligns.cpp:262-265`). `penalty = ceil(log2(gspan) * -0.25 - 0.5)`, typically -2. Reuses `scorer.genomic_length_penalty()`. Fixed 132/144 FPs (144->12). Created 35 new STAR-only misses (122->157) -- latent scoring discrepancy for borderline pairs.

**Phase 16.32 (2026-03-26):** Added `outFilterMultimapNmax` check for PE joint pairs after `filter_paired_transcripts`. If `joint_pairs.len() > outFilterMultimapNmax`, return `TooManyLoci`. Mechanism is correct but blocked for all 12 remaining FPs by upstream scoring inflation that shifts the score-range filter to retain only 1 pair instead of the 12+ needed to trigger the check. Root cause: ruSTAR combined WT score is 36-106 points higher than STAR's finalized combined WT score for these overlapping/repeat-region pairs.

**PE false positives -- updated status (2026-03-26):**

Of the original 144 FPs, 132 were fixed by the `scoreGenomicLengthLog2scale` penalty (Phase 16.31). 12 FPs remain. All 12 are blocked by combined-WT score inflation (36-106 pts above STAR). Root cause analysis:
- 9 FPs: STAR combined WT score 109-193 < 198 threshold (ruSTAR 203-264 > 198). Score inflation ≈ 36-106 pts.
- 2 FPs (2243566, 21434027): STAR nW=0 (no seed windows found); ruSTAR finds 16 and 3 joint_pairs.
- 1 FP (9495507): STAR nTr=12 > outFilterMultimapNmax=10; ruSTAR score-range filter collapses 55→1 pair due to 2-pt inflation at one locus (chr15:14191228 M1 scores 143 vs tied 141 elsewhere).

**Remaining PE gap:** 12 ruSTAR-only false positives, 157 STAR-only missed (35 post-16.31 regressions + 122 pre-existing). See `docs/star_comparison/DIFFERENCES.md`.

**Position disagreement reclassification (2026-04-01):**

All 127 position disagreements (100 diff-chr + 27 same-chr) verified as **genuine ties** via STAR debug tracing. Both tools find identical alignment sets; difference is only primary selection order based on SA iteration.

**Phase 16.37 (alignIntronMax=0 fix, 2026-04-02):**
- `ERR12389696.5825571` **FIXED**: alignIntronMax=0 should mean no limit (STAR: `if Del>alignIntronMax && alignIntronMax>0`). ruSTAR used finite limit 589824; fixed to `u32::MAX`. Now aligns as `XV:80779 121M607028N13M16S` (607kb intron, exact STAR match).
- `ERR12389696.16030539` **MAPQ FIXED**: Both tools now find XV:121224 and XV:598336 with MAPQ=3. Differs only in primary tie-breaking. MAPQ inflate: 1→0.
- `ERR12389696.13573895`: Investigated. Root cause is seed-level tie in homopolymer region — 71-base seed found at RC pos 29 (ruSTAR) vs 37 (STAR). Both score AS=133. Insertion placement differs (100 vs 108). Not fixable without matching STAR's exact Lmapped chain traversal.

**Remaining fixable SE issues (deferred):**

| Issue | Count | Difficulty |
|-------|-------|------------|
| CIGAR insertion placement | 1 | Hard — `ERR12389696.13573895` (AS=133 both, same pos, seed-level tie in homopolymer) |
| ruSTAR false splice (adapter contamination, 279 kb intron) | 1 | Medium — `ERR12389696.18296181` |
| STAR-only mapped (high-mismatch read NM=10) | 1 | Unknown — `ERR12389696.13766843` |
| MAPQ inflation | 0 | **FIXED Phase 16.37** |
| MAPQ deflation | 0 | **FIXED Phase 16.36** |

**Current PE gap (Phase 16.37):** ruSTAR=8400 vs STAR=8390 (+10 ruSTAR over). ~16 ruSTAR-only FPs (~13 pre-existing, ~3 splice-related, score inflation root cause TBD). ~6 STAR-only mates. See `docs/star_comparison/DIFFERENCES.md`.

**Phase 16.41 (junction split fix, 2026-04-09):**
Root cause: `split_working_transcript` copied ALL junction data (including the inter-mate cross-iFrag boundary junction) to BOTH halves. Single-exon mates with `n_junction>0` triggered the spliced-mate mapped length check (`total_mapped >= 0.66*readLen`), failing mates with only 78 matched bases (78 < 99).

Fix: split junction arrays at `boundary_idx`. wt1 (first `boundary_idx` exons) gets junctions `[0..boundary_idx-1)`, wt2 gets junctions `[boundary_idx..n_junctions)`. The boundary junction at index `boundary_idx-1` (canonSJ=-3, inter-mate gap) is dropped from both halves.

Result: `ERR12389696.1783008` **FIXED** (STAR-only → now correctly mapped: mate2 `2S78M70S`, mate1 `18S78M86N54M` at XVI:678116). Also correctly filtered 3-4 former FPs. Net: 8392→8389 ruSTAR vs STAR 8390 (-1 gap). 2 ruSTAR FPs remain, 3 STAR-only remain (pre-existing multi-mappers). SE: unchanged 8795/8925.
