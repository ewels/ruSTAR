# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Git Workflow

**DO NOT commit changes automatically.** The user will review, test, and commit changes themselves. Claude should:
- Make code changes as requested
- Suggest what should be committed
- Let the user handle `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`

## Project Overview

ruSTAR is a Rust reimplementation of [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference), an RNA-seq aligner originally written in C++ by Alexander Dobin. Licensed under MIT to match the original STAR license.

The primary goal is a faithful port — matching the original STAR behavior as closely as possible. Extra features and divergences from the original will come in later releases/forks. When implementing, refer to the [STAR source code](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) to ensure correctness and behavioral parity.

## Build Commands

Rust 2024 edition. Standard Cargo commands:

```bash
cargo build            # Debug build
cargo build --release  # Release build
cargo test             # Run all tests
cargo test <name>      # Run a single test by name
cargo clippy           # Lint
cargo fmt              # Format code
```

Always run `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo test` before considering a phase complete.

## Current Status

**268 tests passing, 0 clippy warnings.** SE: 99.7% position agreement (adjusted), 99.9% CIGAR (pos-agreeing), 2.2% splice rate (STAR: 2.2%), 66 shared junctions, **100.0% MAPQ agreement, MAPQ inflation: 0, deflation: 0**. 127 position disagreements (ALL verified as genuine ties). 1 CIGAR-only disagree (ERR12389696.13573895, insertion placement, seed-level tie). 3 truly actionable SE issues remain. PE: **8400/8390 both-mapped (+10 ruSTAR over STAR)**, 0 half-mapped, ~16 ruSTAR-only FPs, 98.9% per-mate position agreement (Phase 16.37: alignIntronMax=0 fix). See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed phase tracking and [docs/](docs/) for per-phase notes.

## Development Philosophy — Match STAR Exactly

**Never backtrack on changes that make the method closer to STAR's logic, even if metrics temporarily regress.** A regression in alignment statistics (position agreement, splice rate, etc.) after making the code more STAR-faithful does NOT mean the change was wrong — it means the implementation is incomplete. More STAR-matching changes are needed to close the gap.

- It is better to go backwards in metrics temporarily to eventually reach 100% matching results, than to keep approximate methods that can never get there.
- Every algorithm, threshold, and code path should match STAR's C++ source exactly. Any deviation — even a small one — should be corrected.
- Do not revert STAR-faithful changes. Instead, investigate what STAR does differently in the surrounding logic and implement that too.
- When a STAR-matching change causes regression, the response is: "What else does STAR do that we don't?" — not "revert and try something different."

## Key Conventions

- **Crate name is `ruSTAR`** — `#![allow(non_snake_case)]` in lib.rs suppresses the crate name warning
- **STAR params use `--camelCase` naming** — clap `#[arg(long = "camelCase")]` maps to snake_case Rust fields
- **Multi-value params** (genomeFastaFiles, readFilesIn, outSAMtype, outSAMattributes, chimOutType, alignSJstitchMismatchNmax, outSJfilterIntronMaxVsReadN) need explicit `num_args`
- **Negative defaults** (scoreGapNoncan=-8, readMapNumber=-1, etc.) need `allow_hyphen_values = true`
- **`outSAMtype`** is parsed as raw `Vec<String>` then structured via `Parameters::out_sam_type()` method
- **Validation** beyond clap's type checking is in `Parameters::validate()` (e.g. genomeGenerate requires FASTA files)
- **No async** — CPU-bound work; async adds complexity with zero benefit
- **Error handling** — `thiserror` for `Error` enum, `anyhow` for top-level result propagation

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4", features = ["derive"] }
anyhow = "1"
thiserror = "2"
log = "0.4"
env_logger = "0.11"

## Testing Pattern

- Unit tests: `#[cfg(test)]` in each module
- Integration tests: `tests/` directory (future phases)
- Every phase uses differential testing against STAR where applicable
- Test data tiers: synthetic micro-genome → chr22 → full human genome

**Current test status**: 268/268 tests passing (264 unit + 4 integration), 0 clippy warnings

## Known Issues — Disagreement Root Causes (10k SE yeast)

**127 total position disagreements — ALL verified as genuine ties** (confirmed via STAR debug tracing):

Both tools find identical alignment sets for all 127 disagreements. The primary difference is tie-breaking order (SA iteration order). Neither alignment is more correct than the other.

- **100 diff-chr ties** — same set of alignments, different repeat copy chosen as primary.
- **27 same-chr ties** — same alignment set, different primary due to tie-breaking (includes multi-intron reads where both tools find same 2 alignments but select different primaries).

**1 CIGAR-only disagreement (same position, different CIGAR):**
- `ERR12389696.13573895`: both tools align to XV:218357 MAPQ=255, but ruSTAR gives `100M1I45M4S` (insertion at read pos 100) while STAR gives `108M1I37M4S` (insertion at 108). Root cause: both alignments score AS=133. The 71-base seed is found at RC pos 29 (ruSTAR) vs RC pos 37 (STAR) due to different Lmapped chain paths through a long homopolymer region. Same diagonal, different starting position → different insertion placement. Seed-level tie.

**3 truly actionable SE issues:**

1. **ruSTAR-only false splice (1 read)** — `ERR12389696.18296181` maps with 279kb intron (adapter contamination pattern, likely spurious).
2. **STAR-only (1 read)** — `ERR12389696.13766843` high-mismatch read (NM=10), not mapped by ruSTAR.
3. **CIGAR-only insertion placement (1 read)** — `ERR12389696.13573895` (see above). Requires matching STAR's exact Lmapped chain to fix.

**Phase 16.37 (alignIntronMax=0 fix) resolved:**
- `ERR12389696.5825571`: now aligns as `XV:80779 121M607028N13M16S` (exact match with STAR). Root cause: ruSTAR computed a finite intron limit of 589824 when `alignIntronMax=0`, blocking the 607kb intron. STAR uses `>0` guard in `stitchAlignToTranscript.cpp` line 100 — alignIntronMax=0 means no limit. Fix: use `u32::MAX` sentinel in score.rs.
- `ERR12389696.16030539`: MAPQ inflation resolved. Both tools now find two alignments (XV:121224 128M925400N10M12S and XV:598336 128M448288N10M12S), both MAPQ=3. Primary selection differs (tie). MAPQ inflate: 1→0.

## PE Status (Updated 2026-04-01 — Phase 16.36)

**Phase 16.36** (post-finalization dedup) is the latest. Current PE parity: ruSTAR=8400 vs STAR=8390, ruSTAR +10 over STAR.

**Phase 16.33** fixed zero-insert RF pairs (e.g. `ERR12389696.10454315`) by adding `no_left_ext: bool` to `finalize_transcript`. Two cascading bugs were fixed:
1. **extlen signed arithmetic** (`stitch_align_to_transcript`): when `wa.sa_pos < first_exon.genome_start`, old unsigned code fell back to `wa.read_pos` (gave extlen=198→2-base extension). Fixed to signed i64 = STAR's `gBstart - EX_G + EX_R` formula (gives extlen=1).
2. **mate2 left-extension suppression** (`finalize_transcript`): after split, wt2.read_start=46; per-mate finalize tried to extend leftward 46 bases into adapter, spuriously matching 1 adapter base. Added `no_left_ext: bool` param; pass `true` for mate2 (fwd cluster) and rc_mate1 (rev cluster).

**Current PE parity**: ruSTAR=8400 vs STAR=8390. ruSTAR +10 over STAR. ~16 ruSTAR-only FPs (~13 pre-existing non-splice reads, ~3 splice-related). 6 STAR-only mates. 75 diff-chr disagreements per mate (unavoidable multi-mapper ties), ~21-24 same-chr per mate (some fixable).

## Remaining Limitations (Top 5)

- No coordinate-sorted BAM output (use `samtools sort`) — Phase 17.2
- No PE chimeric detection — Phase 17.3
- No `--quantMode GeneCounts` — Phase 17.8
- No `--outStd SAM/BAM` (stdout output) — Phase 17.6
- No STARsolo single-cell features — Phase 14 (deferred)
