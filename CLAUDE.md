# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Git Workflow

**DO NOT commit changes automatically.** The user will review, test, and commit changes themselves. Claude should:
- Make code changes as requested
- Suggest what should be committed
- Let the user handle `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`

## Project Overview

ruSTAR is a Rust reimplementation of [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference), an RNA-seq aligner originally written in C++ by Alexander Dobin. Licensed under MIT to match the original STAR license.

The primary goal is a faithful port — matching the original STAR behavior as closely as possible. Extra features and divergences from the original will come in later releases/forks. When implementing, refer to the [STAR source code](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) to ensure correctness and behavioral parity.

## Build Commands

Rust 2024 edition. Standard Cargo commands:

```bash
cargo build            # Debug build
cargo build --release  # Release build
cargo test             # Run all tests
cargo test <name>      # Run a single test by name
cargo clippy           # Lint
cargo fmt              # Format code
```

Always run `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check`, and `cargo test` before considering a phase complete.

## Development Philosophy — Match STAR Exactly

**Never backtrack on changes that make the method closer to STAR's logic, even if metrics temporarily regress.** A regression in alignment statistics (position agreement, splice rate, etc.) after making the code more STAR-faithful does NOT mean the change was wrong — it means the implementation is incomplete. More STAR-matching changes are needed to close the gap.

- It is better to go backwards in metrics temporarily to eventually reach 100% matching results, than to keep approximate methods that can never get there.
- Every algorithm, threshold, and code path should match STAR's C++ source exactly. Any deviation — even a small one — should be corrected.
- Do not revert STAR-faithful changes. Instead, investigate what STAR does differently in the surrounding logic and implement that too.
- When a STAR-matching change causes regression, the response is: "What else does STAR do that we don't?" — not "revert and try something different."

## Key Conventions

- **Crate name is `ruSTAR`** — `#![allow(non_snake_case)]` in lib.rs suppresses the crate name warning
- **STAR params use `--camelCase` naming** — clap `#[arg(long = "camelCase")]` maps to snake_case Rust fields
- **Multi-value params** (genomeFastaFiles, readFilesIn, outSAMtype, outSAMattributes, chimOutType, alignSJstitchMismatchNmax, outSJfilterIntronMaxVsReadN) need explicit `num_args`
- **Negative defaults** (scoreGapNoncan=-8, readMapNumber=-1, etc.) need `allow_hyphen_values = true`
- **`outSAMtype`** is parsed as raw `Vec<String>` then structured via `Parameters::out_sam_type()` method
- **Validation** beyond clap's type checking is in `Parameters::validate()` (e.g. genomeGenerate requires FASTA files)
- **No async** — CPU-bound work; async adds complexity with zero benefit
- **Error handling** — `thiserror` for `Error` enum, `anyhow` for top-level result propagation

## Dependencies

anyhow = "1"
thiserror = "2"

## Testing Pattern

- Unit tests: `#[cfg(test)]` in each module
- Integration tests: `tests/` directory (future phases)
- Every phase uses differential testing against STAR where applicable
- Test data tiers: synthetic micro-genome → chr22 → full human genome

**Current test status**: 278/278 tests passing (274 unit + 4 integration), 0 clippy warnings

## Known Issues — Disagreement Root Causes (10k SE yeast)

**127 total position disagreements — ALL verified as genuine ties** (confirmed via STAR debug tracing):

Both tools find identical alignment sets for all 127 disagreements. The primary difference is tie-breaking order (SA iteration order). Neither alignment is more correct than the other.

- **100 diff-chr ties** — same set of alignments, different repeat copy chosen as primary.
- **27 same-chr ties** — same alignment set, different primary due to tie-breaking (includes multi-intron reads where both tools find same 2 alignments but select different primaries).

**1 CIGAR-only disagreement (same position, different CIGAR):**
- `ERR12389696.13573895`: both tools align to XV:218357 MAPQ=255, but ruSTAR gives `100M1I45M4S` (insertion at read pos 100) while STAR gives `108M1I37M4S` (insertion at 108). Root cause: both alignments score AS=133. The 71-base seed is found at RC pos 29 (ruSTAR) vs RC pos 37 (STAR) due to different Lmapped chain paths through a long homopolymer region. Same diagonal, different starting position → different insertion placement. Seed-level tie.

**1 truly actionable SE issue:**

1. **CIGAR-only insertion placement (1 read)** — `ERR12389696.13573895` (see above). Requires matching STAR's exact Lmapped chain to fix.

Previously listed issues now resolved:
- `ERR12389696.18296181` (ruSTAR-only false splice): filtered out by score threshold (score=95/92 < 98 threshold for 150bp read). Both the 1-exon soft-clip AND the 2-exon false splice fail the minimum score gate — read correctly unmapped.
- `ERR12389696.13766843` (STAR-only NM=10 read): ruSTAR already maps this correctly (VII:24449, 28S121M1S, MAPQ=255) — it was incorrectly listed as "STAR-only".

**Phase 16.38 (STAR-faithful filter ordering):**
- Moved dedup + score-range filter (multMapSelect) to run BEFORE quality filters (mappedFilter). STAR's ordering: `multMapSelect → mappedFilter`. Old code ran quality filters first, which could remove the high-scoring primary leaving a lower-scoring secondary as apparent "best". No benchmark change (the specific false splice read was already filtered by score threshold), but structurally correct for edge cases.

**Phase 16.37 (alignIntronMax=0 fix) resolved:**
- `ERR12389696.5825571`: now aligns as `XV:80779 121M607028N13M16S` (exact match with STAR). Root cause: ruSTAR computed a finite intron limit of 589824 when `alignIntronMax=0`, blocking the 607kb intron. STAR uses `>0` guard in `stitchAlignToTranscript.cpp` line 100 — alignIntronMax=0 means no limit. Fix: use `u32::MAX` sentinel in score.rs.
- `ERR12389696.16030539`: MAPQ inflation resolved. Both tools now find two alignments (XV:121224 128M925400N10M12S and XV:598336 128M448288N10M12S), both MAPQ=3. Primary selection differs (tie). MAPQ inflate: 1→0.

## PE Status (Updated 2026-04-22 — Phase E4: PE-CHECK2 unconditional)

**Phase E4** (PE-CHECK2 unconditional): **PE both-mapped = 8337** (STAR: 8390), **half-mapped = 0**, **98.9% per-mate position agreement**, **98.800% PE exact faithfulness** (was 98.470%). MAPQ inflations: 2 (was 4), deflations: 4 (was 34). NH diffs: 12 (was 50).

**Phase E3** (2026-04-22, combined-threshold half-mapped): half-mapped 311→0, faithfulness 98.211%→98.470%.

**Phase E fix** (2026-04-21, mate_id-aware diagonal dedup): raised faithfulness from 93.920%→97.370%. Still present.

**Phase E4 implementation**: Removed `m1_exons.len() > 1` guard from PE-CHECK2 in `split_combined_wt`. STAR applies PE-CHECK2 unconditionally (verified via debug trace: `PE-CHECK2: m1_end=11656633 m2_estEnd=11656632 REJECT=1` for single-exon mate1). Previously ruSTAR only checked for spliced mate1, allowing overlapping/short-insert pairs through.

**Current PE parity**: 8337 vs STAR 8390 (53 short). The 60 STAR-only pairs are heavily soft-clipped reads (50%+ clipped) where ruSTAR can't find sufficient seeds. Not a regression from PE-CHECK2.

## Remaining Limitations (Top 5)

- No coordinate-sorted BAM output (use `samtools sort`) — Phase 17.2
- No PE chimeric detection — Phase 17.3
- No `--outStd SAM/BAM` (stdout output) — Phase 17.6
- No `--outReadsUnmapped Fastx` — Phase 17.4
- No STARsolo single-cell features — Phase 14 (deferred)
